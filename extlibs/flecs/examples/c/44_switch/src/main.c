#include <switch.h>

/* This example shows how to use switch and case roles, which let an application
 * build efficient state machines. Without switch and case, an application would
 * have to add a separate tag for each state, while ensuring that the previous
 * state is removed. This is not only less usable, but also not very performant.
 *
 * With tags, different combinations of states can grow quickly, which can
 * scatter entities across many different tables. With switches, entities with
 * different states are still stored in the same table, which makes it much
 * faster to change states, and improves iteration performance.
 *
 * Additionally, adding a case to an entity will remove the previous case, which
 * makes the switch/case combination especially suited for state machihnes.
